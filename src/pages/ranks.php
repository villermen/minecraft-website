<h1>Ranks</h1>

There's a few different ranks on the server.<br />
All of them are displayed below.<br />
<div class='spacer'></div>
<h3 class='mc7'>Guest</h3>
This is the default rank for new players.<br />
You can't build in any of the worlds with it, and it pretty much is just like being a spectator in other games.<br />
If you want to be able to build (=get the member rank), read how to below.<br />

<h3 class='mc9'>Member</h3>
Members are players able to build in creative &amp; vanilla.<br />
To get member, you must sign up on this site and have an admin to promote you (be aware that they check whether you actually did sign up).<br />
There are a lot of commands available to members, especially in creative.<br />
Please head over to the <a href='?p=worlds'>worlds page</a> if you want to read a list of all of them.<br />

<h3 class='mc9'>Member+</h3>
A week after sign up you can ask an admin to promote you to member+.<br />
Players with a member+ rank get some additional features that are blocked to regular members to prevent griefing.<br />
Features include being able to build with lava &amp; water in creative, place TNT in vanilla.<br />
Again for a full list of additional features please read them on the <a href='?p=worlds'>worlds page</a>.<br />

<h3 class='mc2'>Donator</h3>
Donators have showed their support to the server by funding it with $5.00 or more.<br />
They are therefor also trustworthy and get some extra powerful features in the creative worlds.<br />
Flatland is a world where only donators can build, which means it is a world free from any form of griefing.<br />
Donators who donated $8.00 or more can use WorldEdit, a powerful editing tool in the creative worlds.<br />
They can also pick their own rank, or no rank for themselves.<br />
For a full list of donator only features, and how to donate, head over to the <a href='?p=donating'>donating page</a>.<br />

<h3 class='mc6'>Moneybag</h3>
For people that donated over 15 dollars.

<h3 class='mc4'>Admin</h3>
Admins are on the server to maintain peace &amp; prevent/rollback griefings.<br />
It's in general a good idea to listen to what they have to say to you because it usually is important.<br />
Please note that admins also want to play the game for their amusement next to their function, and can't help you with your needs all the time.<br />
Only donators have a chance to become an admin, and only if they want it and meet the expectations of one of course.";
