	This website is developed for real browsers, like Chrome and Firefox.<br />
	If you use a browser that doesn't work, like Internet Explorer, some parts of the site might not look too stunning.<br />
	This is your bad, since you chose for Internet Explorer.<br />
	If you think it's time for a real browser, try Chrome or Firefox, they actually work.<br />
	I will not fix any visual bug that occurs only in Internet Explorer, so don't whine about it, it's my policy.
