<h1>Rules</h1>

The following rules apply on this server:
<ul>
	<li>Naturally, griefing is not tolerated in any way. If you grief you will be banned without warning.</li>
	<li>Be polite and respect your fellow builders, try not to offend them.</li>
	<li>Don't spam or troll. This includes TALKING IN CAPS.</li>
	<li>Don't excessively swear. If you're mad about something that didn't work out, you're allowed to use some cursing, but please keep it at minimum.</li>
	<li>Pvp is only allowed if both parties agree on it.</li>
	<li>Don't make server lag on purpose, for everyone's sake.</li>
	<li>The chat is meant for english. This means you can only talk another language if no one from a different country is around, or use private messages.</li>
	<li>Don't ask for OP or admin, I'll decide who is suitable for that.</li>
	<li>If for some reason you can do something that is not supposed to be enabled, contact me as soon as possible. (Remember that it could also be used against you if so)</li>
	<li>Don't use cheat mods in vanilla. This includes xray, flymod, force-field etc. to not give you an unfair advantage over others. Cheating in creative won't really hurt much.</li>
	<li>Use your common sense.</li>
</ul>

The usual way an admin behaves when a player breaks the rule, is that the admin first warns the player.<br />
Then if the player doesn't change his behaviour, the admin kicks this player.<br />
Eventually if the player still misbehaves, a ban will be required.<br />
Griefing on purpose always immediately results in a ban. (of course admins will check thoroughly if it was on purpose first)";
